    <h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black<br> Highlighters All These Years</h1>
        
    <h2>Director Demands Investigation</h2>

    <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the <br>
    CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black <br>
    highlighters.</p>

    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred <br>
        by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that <br>
        began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
    
    <p>CIA Director <strong>Peter Gross</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several <br>
        historic events, such as: 
    </p>
  
    <ul>
       <li>the Cold War</li>
       <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
       <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
   </ul>
