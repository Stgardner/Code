        <p> It was a quarter past 4 today when a local area man decided<br>
        to come into the local deli and intently study the menu. He <br>
        could be seen glancing over the various options while<br>
        carefully considering the sandwiches it contained. 
        </p>
         
        <p> There were many choices to consider so this glancing took several<br>
        minutes. It was noted by several witnesses that eventually<br>
        the area man decided on a <strong>bacon turkey club</strong>... which is<br>
        notable different from his usual <b>roasted chicken</b>.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            As far as we know, the man enjoyed the sandwich. Sources are<br>
            reporting they heard him say, "an easy 8/10". Area man is known <br>
            for being a rather tough critic so all sandwich makers were relieved<br>
            upon learning of these relatively high marks.
